# QBOX

QBox is a high quality extruded aluminium enclosure designed to house the full range of Raspberry Pi single board computers and to provide makers with a versatile housing complete with an optional LCD display that offers expansion capability for one or two additional HATs.

As well as the housing hardware, two Carrier Boards are available. CB-1 is for the Pi 3A+ and Pi Zero 2 W. CB-2 is a carrier board for the Pi4 and Pi5. Both carrier boards expose the 40 pin Pi connector and offer QWIIC and GROVE expansion sockets whilst the CB-2 adds an NVMe M.2 connector for SSDs with an onboard 3v3, 2.5 Amp power regulator for the SSD.  
 
QBox measures 90 x 90 x 90 mm and is available in silver or black anodised finishes. Front and rear panels are gloss black acrylic and the front panels are designed to hold 2.4 inch or 2.8 inch LCD displays with full colour 320x240 or 640x480 resolution.
